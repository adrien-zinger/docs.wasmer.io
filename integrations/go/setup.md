# Setup your Go environment

To be able to run Wasmer inside our Go application, we will need Go to be installed in our system.

The easiest way to get [Go](https://golang.org/) in your system is to follow the official [documentation](https://golang.org/doc/install).

To ensure it is installed, let's run the following:

```bash
go version # This will show the Go version
```

{% hint style="success" %}
If this command work, Go is successfully installed!
{% endhint %}

## Start a Go project

Now it's time to create a new project and add Wasmer as a dependency:

```bash
mkdir wasmer-project
cd wasmer-project
go mod init github.com/$USER/wasmer-project
```

Now, edit the `go.mod` file to add `wasmer-go` as a dependency:

```bash
require (
    github.com/wasmerio/wasmer-go v1.0.0
)
```

{% hint style="info" %}
For a detailed installation instructions, please refer to Wasmer Go integration [documentation](https://github.com/wasmerio/wasmer-go).
{% endhint %}

Next, let's take a look at some examples!
